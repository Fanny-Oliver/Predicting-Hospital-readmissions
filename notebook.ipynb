The hospital gave you access to ten years of information on patients readmitted to the hospital after being discharged. The doctors want you to assess if initial diagnoses, number of procedures, or other variables could help them better understand the probability of readmission. \n\nThey want to focus follow-up calls and attention on those patients with a higher probability of readmission.","metadata":{},"id":"9a9ada08-c9f0-466f-91a0-265fa539f9f5","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Install and load some of the packages","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5c6a51cc-0c76-4746-8bec-ac0631c2b49a"},{"source":"install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ninstall.packages(\"broom\")\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(tidyr)","metadata":{"executionTime":1161,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ninstall.packages(\"broom\")\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(tidyr)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"a43293db-c12e-40bd-b1e8-5b40afdec65e","execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Installing tidyverse [2.0.0] ...\n\tOK [linked cache]\nInstalling broom [1.0.3] ...\n\tOK [linked cache]\n"}]},{"source":"## ðŸ’¾ The data and the columns. \nYou have access to ten years of patient information ([source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)):\n\n#### Information in the file\n- \"age\" - age bracket of the patient\n- \"time_in_hospital\" - days (from 1 to 14)\n- \"n_procedures\" - number of procedures performed during the hospital stay\n- \"n_lab_procedures\" - number of laboratory procedures performed during the hospital stay\n- \"n_medications\" - number of medications administered during the hospital stay\n- \"n_outpatient\" - number of outpatient visits in the year before a hospital stay\n- \"n_inpatient\" - number of inpatient visits in the year before the hospital stay\n- \"n_emergency\" - number of visits to the emergency room in the year before the hospital stay\n- \"medical_specialty\" - the specialty of the admitting physician\n- \"diag_1\" - primary diagnosis (Circulatory, Respiratory, Digestive, etc.)\n- \"diag_2\" - secondary diagnosis\n- \"diag_3\" - additional secondary diagnosis\n- \"glucose_test\" - whether the glucose serum came out as high (> 200), normal, or not performed\n- \"A1Ctest\" - whether the A1C level of the patient came out as high (> 7%), normal, or not performed\n- \"change\" - whether there was a change in the diabetes medication ('yes' or 'no')\n- \"diabetes_med\" - whether a diabetes medication was prescribed ('yes' or 'no')\n- \"readmitted\" - if the patient was readmitted at the hospital ('yes' or 'no') \n\n***Acknowledgments**: Beata Strack, Jonathan P.

Some doctors believe diabetes might play a central role in readmission. Explore the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on readmission rates.\n\nThis question requires me to check if the doctors assumption that diabetes plays a central role in readmission is true. I will be running a hypothesis test to see if there is a relationship between a diabetes diagnosis and readmission rates. \n\nSince the variables I am going to be comparing are categorical variables, the test I will be using will be a chi-square test for independence. Also, there are 3 diagnosis columns, so I will be conducting 3 seperate test to determine which of them has a significant effect on readmission rates.\n\nLet's start by definig our **hypotheses:**\n- **Null hypothesis (H0): There is no relationship between diabetes diagnosis and the readmission rates.**\n- **Alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant relationship between diabetes diagnosis and the readmission rates.**\n\nNow, that we have defined the hypotheses, I will be converting the \"diag_1\", \"diag_2\", \"diag_3\" columns to have \"Diabetes\" and \"Not diabetes\". I am doing this so I don't confuse myself later. I will also make the \"readmitted\" column a factor so it doesn't count like a number.\n\nLastly, let's set a significance level of 5%. \n- If the p-value is < or = the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and adopt the alternative hypothesis;\n- If the p-value is > the significance level, we retain the null hypothesis.\n\nLet's begin ~","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ab560771-8058-4aa7-854a-4f7fd16b675f"},{"source":"### The first diaabetes diagnosis vs. readmission rates","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fda8ac84-02c6-4a2b-9497-98b20b876202"},{"source":"#create a new_df for the dataset to visualize it\n#recode the diabetes vallues to \"diabetes and not diabetes\" and make the readmitted column a factor\nreadmissions$diag_1 <- ifelse(readmissions$diag_1 == \"Diabetes\", \"Diabetes\", \"Not Diabetes\")\nreadmissions$readmitted <- as.factor(readmissions$readmitted)\n\ndiabetes1 <- readmissions %>% \n  group_by(diag_1, readmitted) %>% \n  summarize(Freq = n()) %>% \n  mutate(Prop = Freq/sum(Freq)) %>% \n  arrange(Prop)\ndiabetes1\n","metadata":{"executionTime":165,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"#create a new_df for the dataset to visualize it\n#recode the diabetes vallues to \"diabetes and not diabetes\" and make the readmitted column a factor\nreadmissions$diag_1 <- ifelse(readmissions$diag_1 == \"Diabetes\", \"Diabetes\", \"Not Diabetes\")\nreadmissions$readmitted <- as.factor(readmissions$readmitted)\n\ndiabetes1 <- readmissions %>% \n  group_by(diag_1, readmitted) %>% \n  summarize(Freq = n()) %>% \n  mutate(Prop = Freq/sum(Freq)) %>% \n  arrange(Prop)\ndiabetes1\n"},"cell_type":"code","id":"236e7bfe-228c-4c46-a02a-5d77678a6770","execution_count":58,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":"\u001b[1m\u001b[22m`summarise()` has grouped output by 'diag_1'.

It wasn't part of the factors added by the stepwise regression method.\n\nFrom the summary, we first see the formula that we used for our regression analysis. Then we see the residuals, from a glance, it looks like it is fairly distributed and the center value is close to zero.\n\nNext, we see the coefficients that make up our model. From here, we see the estimate which is the make up of the formula. Next is the standard deviation which shows us by how much the value is deviating from the mean. Then we see the z-value and lastly the p-value. Most of the figures of the p-value are statistically significant as they are less than 5%. For the values that are greater than 5%(age), I will be leaving them in the model as I believe that they are needed and the rest are not very far from the significanle level as well.

That is, what actualy happened (actual response) and what you said will happen (predicted response). \n\nIn the summary, only 3 things are important, **the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.** The **accuracy** is **61.2%**, this is the percentage of the total correct predictions about the probability of readmissions. Second is **sensitivity**, which is **41%**, this is the proportion of true positives, that is out of the total number of people that were readmitted, we were able to correctly predict just 41% of them. Last is the **specificity**, which is the proportion of true negatives. The specificity is **79%**. This means that out of the total number of people that were **not** readmitted, we were able to correctly predict 79% of them.

The most common diagnosis across all age groups are Circulatory and Respiratory diagnosis.\n2. Diabetes plays a important role in the readmission rates. People with the first and second diagnosis of diabetes are highly likely to be readmitted.\n3. Some other factors that could affect or influence readmission rates like number of procedures, use of diabetes medication, number of emergency, time in hospital, etc., are included in the model that I used to predict readmission rates.\n4. With an accuracy of 61%, more accurate methods of analysis can be carried out to increase the accuracy of the predictions.
